# Travel Plans

## Prerequisites

Strapi does not support Node 15 or higher at the moment. If you run into an error similar to the one below:

```txt
The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=10.16.0 <=14.x.x". Got "15.x.x"

```

It is recommended to switch to Node 14 via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) .

## Usage

### Install deps

`npm run bootstrap`

### Start dev server

`npm run --prefix server develop`

### Start app dev server

`npm run --prefix app start`
